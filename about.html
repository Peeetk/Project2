      Few words about my knowledge and skills as a bartender!

    <h3 class="h3">I have been making coffee since I was 13 year old!</h3>
    <p class="story">
      When I was a kid, I spent my time with my father who had a little coffe
      shop in the town. I loved the smell of the coffe and always wanted to try
      it, but I was too little, so my father showed me first how to brew a real
      esspresso... Few weeks later he has teached me for basic. When I was 17
      years old I was working by my self in the shop after school and very soon
      I'have took over the place. I am still running this coffe shop after 10
      years. I am 27 now and I went to many schools to learn the best practices
      to make the best coffe, latte, macchiato, and I have gained my own coffes
      too that you can find in the "Menu" option. I want you to try all of them,
      and don't forget to leave feedback in the "Contact" menu option.
